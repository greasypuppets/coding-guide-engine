# Coding Guide Engine

A coding guide is a useful tool for creating a consistent and easy-to-learn code base.  Similar to style guides in publishing, coding guides provide a set of rules around how source code is to be written for an organization.  These rules tend to be cosmetic and not defined by the coding language's syntax rules.  A code base written in a consistent style is easier to read, learn, and maintain.  Coding guides are so important that some safety standards require the definition of a coding guide for certification. 

Although coding guides are important, they require a lot of effort up front to create from scratch.  Therefor, it is common for organizations to adopt a publicly available coding guide.  This is convenient, but the personal preferences of leadership tend to assert themselves into the guide.  This usually requires revisions and versioning efforts.  

Automated tools are available to check code for compliance to a coding guide.  These tools tend to require the generation of files that tell the tool the rule set to check against.  Again, these files require effort.

This product tries to lessen the burden of generating coding guides and tools by presenting the user with a set of questions about style preferences and compiling the results into a formal coding guide document and any definition files needed for popular automation tools.
